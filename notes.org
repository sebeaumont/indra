* Notes

** Complex Numbers 
Can't do this any more or use Owl since it is tied to the standard complex
number module in stdlib which is inaadequate for our purposes.

#+begin_src ocaml
   module Matrix = struct
   open Mobius
   module M = Owl.Dense.Matrix.Z

   let as_matrix m = M.of_array [| m.a; m.b; m.c; m.d |] 2 2
   let matrix_compose mat1 mat2 = M.(mat1 *@ mat2)
   end
#+end_src
